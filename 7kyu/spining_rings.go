//Imagine two rings with numbers on them. The inner ring spins clockwise (decreasing by 1 each spin) and the outer ring spins counter clockwise (increasing by 1 each spin). We start with both rings aligned on 0 at the top, and on each move we spin each ring one increment. How many moves will it take before both rings show the same number at the top again?

//The inner ring has integers from 0 to innerMax and the outer ring has integers from 0 to outerMax, where innerMax and outerMax are integers >= 1.

//e.g. if innerMax is 2 and outerMax is 3 then after
//1 move: inner = 2, outer = 1
//2 moves: inner = 1, outer = 2
//3 moves: inner = 0, outer = 3
//4 moves: inner = 2, outer = 0
//5 moves: inner = 1, outer = 1
//Therefore it takes 5 moves for the two rings to reach the same number
//Therefore spinningRings(2, 3) = 5

//e.g. if innerMax is 3 and outerMax is 2 then after
//1 move: inner = 3, outer = 1
//2 moves: inner = 2, outer = 2
//Therefore it takes 2 moves for the two rings to reach the same number
//spinningRings(3, 2) = 2
